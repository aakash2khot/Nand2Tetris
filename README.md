Nand2Tetris
===========

These are the Nand2Tetris part 1 projects. Nand2tetris is a course which will help us in building the Tetris game from the lowest level of abstraction (gates).
The first 3 projects are taken from this github link:-https://github.com/ComputX-research-group/Nand2Tetris


Nand2Tetris website: http://nand2tetris.org/

* Project 0: Introduction 
* Project 1: Boolean Logic
* Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic
* Project 3: Sequential Logic   
* Project 4: Machine Language 
* Project 5: Computer Architecture  
* Project 6: Assembler   

For Project 6, to run Assembler.py :-

-> python3 Assembler.py folder_name/file_name.asm

folder_name can be add,max,pong etc and file_name can be accordingly to which asm files are present. This will create a new file_name.hack file which is the binary which of the particular asm program. We can use this file to compare with the binary codes we get from Assembler.
